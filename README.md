There are two colors, red and purple, fighting each other. There is no CPU, just two real players. The reload button clears the board and the reset button clears the board and resets each player counter.

Apart from the principal activity, the game itself, there is a stats activity in which we can see the current session stats (coming soon: data persistance).

In the upper section of the app, there is an info button where there are a few links (personal Github, monthly challenge and credits).
