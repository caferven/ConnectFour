# Connect Four

This is an implementation of the classic game Connect Four in Android (Kotlin).

Here's the app: [ConnectFour.apk](https://github.com/caferven/ConnectFour/blob/master/ConnectFour.apk)

- There are two colors, red and purple, fighting each other.
- There is no CPU, just two real players.
- The clear button just clears the board and the reset button clears the board and resets each player counter.

Apart from the principal activity, the game itself, there is a stats activity in which we can see the current session stats (coming soon: data persistance).

In the upper section of the app, there is an info button where there are a few links (personal Github, monthly challenge and credits).
